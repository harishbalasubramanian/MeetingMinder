This is my web app that essentially provides summaries of meetings with full transcripts, summaries, and any action items required.

Furthermore, it analyzes sentiments using a custom neural network that can allow you to understand non-verbal cues going on during the meeting.

I would recommend also using this tool if you're practicing a speech or a talk. It allows you to fully analyze the non-verbal audio and visual cues along with the verbal content of a speech.
